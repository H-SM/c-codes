<<Unique number problem>>
Q1) given 2N+1<<has only 1 unique number>>numbers where every number comes twice except one number.Find out the Unique number.
eg- n=7
    numbers are-3,2,5,1,2,<<6>>,3,1
    6 is the unique number 
approarch -
    . burte force o(n^2)time o(1) space
    . Hashing- hash map o(n)time and o(n) space
    . bit masking - XOR of 2 same numbers(bits of numbers) are same thus getting zero as answer 5 ^ 5 =0, a^b^a=b 
    eg(for bit masking)- 3,5,6,1,5,6,3 for this just find XOR of all numbers in series 3 cuts XOR of 3 , similar for
    other repeating numbers in the series
    i,e; 3^5^6^1^6^5^3=1
    code basic-
    XOR=0
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
        XOR=XOR^a[i]
         ^
     this will contain the result after ending of for loop
    <<<O(1) space, 0(n) time NO HASHTABLE AND IN LINEAR TIME>>>

Q2)given 2N+2<<has 2 unique numbers>> numbers where every number comes twice except one number.Find out the Unique number.
eg- 2,3,4,<<5>>,4,3,<<7>>,2
    if we do XOR , answer- 5^7 = 010  (101^111=010)
    OBSERVATION-
    1) XOR of 2 unique numbers is > 0 alwys
        therefore, atleast one set-bit.
    2) A bit is set when it is present in exactly in one of the numbers.
    ie,
        101
        111
       -----
        010
         ^
        this one is the bit set...
    3) position of any 1 set bit(first set bit from right)
         set bit at p=1
         2,3,3,7,2,6,6

         A(has 2n+1)=2^3^7^3^2^6^6 -> 7
         b=4^5^4 -> 5

Q3) unique number 3N+1 
    where every number comes THRICE except one number.Find out the Unique number.

eg- 5,2,5,<<3>>,5,2,2 
    cant do XOR 5^5^5-> 5
    way to canel out bits of repearing number

    5    1 0 1
    2    0 1 0
    5    1 0 1
    3    0 1 1
    5    1 0 1
    2    0 1 0
    2    0 1 0
       --------  sum along each column
         3 4 4                           unique no. has set bit
                                        .
        sum at each postition -> 3N or 3N+1 where 
                                  ^
                                  if unique number doesnt have set bit
        3 4 4 %3 -> 0 1 1 -> (deci) 3
    
    we can do XOR for porblems like 4N+1 
    and this 3N+1 approach for like 5N+1

TRAVELING SALESMAN
find the shortest round trip cost.
use in minimise cost of last mile delivery/supply chain/ vehicle routing problem
NP-hard problem

brute force approach +dp
start from a 
call for each path
make a tree structure for this like
              A
           /     \
           b        c
        /     \   /     \
        d     e   f       g
        |     |
        c     g
    USING RESURION
    for each point till point d-> A returns 
    this will come from each branch (sum for each traversal added to come back to A from A)
    and take that minimum cost

    base case
    if(all visited)
        return ( cost of returning to source city from current coty)
    else 
    min ccost= min(cost(c)(i)+f(i))
